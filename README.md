#Learning scraping and iPython at IRE 2014#

I know a little Python but I've not ever used it to scrape websites. Last weekend I went to the yearly [Investigative Reporters and Editors](http://ire.org/conferences/ire-2014/) conference for the first time and learned a lot.  When I got back into the office this morning I wanted to make a note of the panels and workshops I attended so that I can look them up later if I wanted to find the tipsheets or contact the speakers. That's when I realized the task could be made a lot easier if I only had a spreadsheet!

Used code and instruction from Anthony DeBarros and Augustin Armendariz to scrape the IRE 2014 conference's 210 panels using the iPython notebook.  The annotated notebook is above as well as the CSV it spit out.
