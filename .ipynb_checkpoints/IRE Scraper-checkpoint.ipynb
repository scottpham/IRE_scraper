Many of those bells were set off by whistleblowers who could no longer ignore their conscience, along with the journalists who were willing to listen to them. Hence we are seeing the most aggressive and destructive campaign waged against whistleblowers and journalists in presidential history. This campaign has destroyed lives, ruined families, exacted immeasurable psychological and physical costs, and ultimately resulted in the demonization of those willing to step forward. Journalists, in particular, face urgent questions about how to protect their sources and themselves, as well as whether they shouldn't more aggressively challenge this \"other war.\"\n",

        "             From Aurora to Sandy Hook to Fort Hood (again), a spate of mass shootings has gripped our attention and fueled a fierce national debate about guns. But there's been a critical problem: Good data on these types of events\u2014and on gun violence more broadly\u2014has been hard to come by, in part due to the suppression of federal research. In the last two years, journalists have worked to fill this void, scouring news reports and combing through limited federal, state, and local government records on guns and gun violence. Several news organizations have built their own data projects documenting mass shootings and gun deaths, and produced quality narrative reporting using them. Yet without an agreed-upon methodology for compiling and analyzing such complex, incomplete data sets, the findings of these investigations have varied. This panel will bring together journalists behind these investigations, and others who have reported on gun violence in notable ways, for a conversation about how to cover this crucial subject matter. Can a set of best practices be determined for gathering gun data, or is there value in having disparate approaches? What data is most important to include? Why has it been so hard to access such information in the past, and what key research has yet to be done? All of this and more will be on the table.\n",
