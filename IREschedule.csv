Detecting corporate fraud - Tips from a crook and a sleuth (Sponsored by Donald W. Reynolds National Center for Business Journalism),http://ire.org/events-and-training/event/975/1411/,"The Donald W. Reynolds National Center for Business Journalism will offer a free pre-conference workshop from 1:30-5 p.m. on Wednesday, June 25. 
 
Attendees will learn the fundamental methods for inspecting public filings for corporate fraud. The information gained in this session will allow reporters to spot red flags in corporate disclosures and understand when to pursue a potential fraud investigation.
 
Instructors Roddy Boyd of the Southern Investigative Reporting Foundation and Sam E. Antar, a convicted felon and CFO of Crazy Eddie, Inc., will take an afternoon to show you how securities fraud is done and how to unearth reams of libel-proof data and facts from corporate financial filings. 
 
Our goal is to pierce the very expensive veil companies erect so that your reporting is never again dependent upon Wall Street and corporate hacks.

No magic bullet: How to track and report on America's gun violence epidemic,http://ire.org/events-and-training/event/975/1385/,"*Moderated by Emily Bell, Columbia Journalism School
 From Aurora to Sandy Hook to Fort Hood (again), a spate of mass shootings has gripped our attention and fueled a fierce national debate about guns. But there's been a critical problem: Good data on these types of events—and on gun violence more broadly—has been hard to come by, in part due to the suppression of federal research. In the last two years, journalists have worked to fill this void, scouring news reports and combing through limited federal, state, and local government records on guns and gun violence. Several news organizations have built their own data projects documenting mass shootings and gun deaths, and produced quality narrative reporting using them. Yet without an agreed-upon methodology for compiling and analyzing such complex, incomplete data sets, the findings of these investigations have varied. This panel will bring together journalists behind these investigations, and others who have reported on gun violence in notable ways, for a conversation about how to cover this crucial subject matter. Can a set of best practices be determined for gathering gun data, or is there value in having disparate approaches? What data is most important to include? Why has it been so hard to access such information in the past, and what key research has yet to be done? All of this and more will be on the table.*Moderated by Emily Bell, Columbia Journalism School From Aurora to Sandy Hook to Fort Hood (again), a spate of mass shootings has gripped our attention and fueled a fierce national debate about guns.

Investigative dashboard (Sponsored by Knight Foundation),http://ire.org/events-and-training/event/975/1426/,"Your stories are international - your research should be too. That vital piece of evidence might be in another country, in another language, in a database you have never heard of before. The Investigative Dashboard helps you find it, both with databases and with personal help from skilled researchers. Come demo the Investigative Dashboard, a research tool of the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project developed in collaboration with Google Ideas.  Try searching the crowd-sourced database, put together by dozens of reporters and civic hackers, which contains over 800,000 company registration records and other related public records from more than 11 countries; or explore more than 400 online databases in 120 jurisdictions where you can search for information on persons of interest and corporations worldwide. If you still cannot find what you need, submit a request to our professional researchers who can search external databases and official filings for evidence of corporate ownership or property holdings that cross borders. Take it for a test drive and it may lead you to that missing link in your investigation.Your stories are international - your research should be too.
